    * X dimension of grid, y dimension of grid, number of agents, grid of agents with T meaning there is an agent and F meaning there isn't an agent, followed by their skill levels
    * Example for grid of 3x3 and 7 Agents
    * 3 3 7

* T
    * T num
    * Tick and the current tick count
* X
    * X x y progress_increase total progress
    * Progress made, x position of agent affecting progress, y position of agent affecting progress, change in progress that the agent made, total progress as of now
    
# How to Run C++ Code
* First run this in the terminal
    * g++ driver.cpp coder.h coder.cpp enviroment.h enviroment.cpp
    * You should get a file like "a.exe" as an output
* Next to run without graphics run this in terminal
    * ./a.exe planning_style coding_style num_coders x_size_of_enviroment y_size_of_enviroment time_spent_in_planning difficulty_level min_starting skill max_starting_skill
    * Example: ./a.exe a a 10 10 4 10 e 0 100
* To run with graphics, in python run the code above with subproccess and then pipe the output to a string
